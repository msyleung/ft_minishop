a mini-ecommerce website designed by the 42 curriculum as part of the PHP Piscine<br>
is classified as a 'rush' project meaning that it must be completed over the weekend in the span of 48hours<br>
this end result is the product of rmanese and sleung's work after those two days.

### things to do / feedback
```
* the Categories on the index.php site should be clickable
* Admin Settings should not be visible for every user (even if it's not accessible)
* add "stock" for each inventory (and "Out of Stock" message)
* admin should be able to add stock to inventory
* add a check-out page
* remove specific quantities of item in cart
* automatically being redirected to cart after each purchase is annoying
* sign up breaks for users with 'a' in the beginning of their login (why?)
* admin messages would be more effective as popups```
