# things to do / feedback
* the Categories on the index.php site should be clickable
* Admin Settings should not be visible for every user (even if it's not accessible)
* add "stock" for each inventory (and "Out of Stock" message)
* admin should be able to add stock to inventory
* add a check-out page
* remove/add specific quantities of item in cart
* automatically being redirected to cart after each purchase is annoying
* sign up breaks for users with 'a' in the beginning of their login (why?)
